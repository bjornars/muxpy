Muxpy
=====

A light-weight python tmux session handler, for saving and
restoring potentially elaborate tmux session setups.


Requirements
============

Muxpy requires Python v2.7. It might work on v2.6, but that would be purely by chance.
Creating sessions requires tmux v1.6 or higher, specifically for its ``list-panes -F`` option.

Usage
=====

1. Save your current awesome setup to ``foobar``. Assuming uid 1000, replace as neccessary.

   ``muxpy -S /tmp/tmux-1000/default create foo``

   This will create a file called ``~/.muxpy/profiles/foo.json``.

2. Edit the file to fine-tune names and such.

   ``muxpy edit foo``

3. Start the new session.

   ``muxpy start foo``

INSTALLATION
============

This program is hosted at the Python Package Index (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Muxpy)
and is a such best installed by ``pip install muxpy``. pip is available from your local
package manager, e.g as ``python-pip`` for debian based systems.

To install from source, a quick git clone followed by ``sudo python setup.py install`` in
the muxpy directory should be quite sufficient.

SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT
================================
